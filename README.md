# Algorithm-for-Slice-Handover-in-5G-Network-Slicing
Prerequisites:
    
     1.1Python Installation: Install Python 3.6 or later from python.org.
    
     1.2Required Libraries: The script uses the following Python libraries:
o	pandas

o	numpy

o	matplotlib

o	openpyxl (for Excel operations)

Install these libraries using pip: pip install pandas numpy matplotlib openpyxl.

Clone the Repository https://github.com/tmuzanenhamo/Algorithm-for-Slice-Handover-in-5G-Networks.git to download the project files and navigate into the directory using cd 5g-slice-handover.

Set Up the Environment

•	python -m venv env

•	source venv/bin/activate   # For Linux/macOS

•	venv\Scripts\activate      # For Windows

Dependencies:


Ensure you have the following modules/files in your working directory:

•	Slices.py (Contains Slices and Slice classes)

•	UseCases.py (Contains the UseCases class)

•	Calculations.py (Contains IntraCalculations and InterCalculations classes)

Execute the Algorithm



Run the algorithm in the terminal:

For Python:


1.Open the terminal in VS Code (Ctrl+`` or View > Terminal).

2.Run the script: python slice_handover.py
python slice_handover.py

Ensure that you have to download the data ( Excelsheet) and save it in the same folder

Debug and Test


1.	Use breakpoints and debugging tools in VS Code to test the algorithm.

2.	Check the terminal for any errors or logs and make adjustments as needed.

View Results


•	The output of the algorithm (e.g., performance metrics, handover success rates) will appear in the terminal or specified output files.
